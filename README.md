### Course Description & Objectives

The goal of this course is to build data management and spreadsheet skills. Students will learn about social and economic data and how it is utilized. They will develop the skills needed to manage, summarize, analyze, and effectively present data. By the end of the semester, students will be able to:
- Define data & understand its uses, including factual reasoning, social science, hypothesis testing & forecasting;
-	Use Excel as a multi-purpose tool with a variety of applications, including taking notes, constructing a household budget, and managing & presenting data;
-	Find data from federal departments and agencies, import it into a spreadsheet, and set it up to make it as easy to work with as possible;
-	Use Excel to manage, summarize, and visualize data with features such as sorts & filters, logical & lookup functions, charts, pivot tables & dashboards;
-	Describe, analyze, and forecast data with simple statistics, correlations, trend lines & regressions;
-	Apply best practices for data management and data visualization.

### Grades

The main criterion for grading assignments is the completion of all the exercises. Points will be deducted if exercises are not completed with reasonable effort (a lower standard than completing all the exercises correctly).

|Assignment           | Grade Points   | Grade Percentage |
|----------|----------|----------|
|Assigments (22*10)   | 220            | 36.98%           |
|Project 1            | 50             | 8.40%            |
|Project 2            | 75             | 12.60%           |
|Project 3            | 100            | 16.81%           |
|Project 4            | 150            | 25.21%           |
|Total                | 595            | 100%             |

One point will be deducted for each hour assignments are submitted late, and five points will be deducted for each hour projects are submitted late, unless you have communicated with the instructor and gotten approval prior to the deadline.
To that end, it is my commitment to you to respond individually to the work you submit in this class and to return your work in a timely manner. Smaller, weekly assignments will be returned within a week and projects will be returned within 2 weeks. (If, however, due to unforeseeable circumstances, the grading of your work takes longer than the times I have listed here, I will keep you informed of my progress and make every effort to return your work with feedback as soon as I can.)


### Accomodation of Needs

I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.
If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class, please contact me to discuss your individual needs. Any accommodation must be discussed in a timely manner. A verifying memo from The Student Disability Center may be required before any accommodation is provided.
